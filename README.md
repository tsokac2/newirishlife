## # [NODE.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Use for NPM `package.json` file implementation into the project root

## # [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Package manager - Use package - `node-sass`

## # [JAVASCRIPT](https://www.javascript.com/)
Features: _Dom Events_, _Validation of User’s Input_, _Else and If Statement_, _Handling Events_,  _In-Built Function_

## # [JQUERY](https://fonts.google.com/)
**APPLIED jQuery DOM EVENTS** for highlighting **_"Quick Links"_** cards elements.

**[TRIP](https://newirishlife.herokuapp.com/trip)**, **[WORK](https://newirishlife.herokuapp.com/work)**, and **[LIFE](https://newirishlife.herokuapp.com/life)** sections are containing **_Quick Links_** card elements.

Every card element contains the _MAIN LINK_ source to the external services provider and a **_"Quick Links..."_** button element for loading detailed links when the user chose the services provider destination. **[EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/wireframes/quicklinks_life.png)**

**_base.html_** template contains <div class="blur"> just after opening tag for the background _"fade-out"_ effect 

**jQuery DOM Events** used for above-mentioned cards element functionality:

* Element with id **#showLinks1** was clicked
* `var thisCardLinkShow = "." + this.id + "-grid";` checking for `<div>` element with class `.showLinks1-grid`
* `$(thisCardLinkShow).show(300)` referring to `this` element to `.show()` with speed of 300 milliseconds
* `$(".blur").fadeIn(400)` loading background "blur" effect with speed of 400 milliseconds
* `$(thisCardLinkShow).addClass("rel-card");` adding class `.addClass("rel-card")` to element that is referring to `this` element
* `$("#Card1").addClass("wrap-rel");`  adding class `.addClass("rel-card")` to element with id **Card1**

The process is replicated for the `<button id="#hideLinks1">` element with the id of `#hideLinks1` for the "hiding" effect with `.removeClass("wrap-rel");` - **[SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/js/cards.js)** from lines **9 - 14** 

If user click anywhere on the screen _"loaded"_ elements will _"hide"_ and that is achieved with following `.click()` DOM effect on `<div class="blur>`.
`.blur` element contains absolute position properties with a z-index of 1000: **[SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/js/cards.js)** from lines **34 - 38**

* `validateName()` function is _**returning**_ Boolean value `true` or `false` that is stored in empty variable `var valid;` depending of a user input string value - **[CODE EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/js/emailnews.js)** from lines **5 - 22**
* Implement call-back functions regarding what kind of input value was submitted by a user.
* `pushSuccessFor()` function is adding a `.success` class to the input element when user input is valid - **[CODE EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/js/emailnews.js)** from lines **55 - 58**
* User email validation is stored in the `validateEmail()` function with a call-back function that is checking user email - **[SOURCE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/js/emailnews.js)**
* To get a valid email id we use a regular expression
* Regular Expression Pattern : `/^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/`
* `testEmail()` function:

  ```
    function testEmail(email) {
        return /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/.test(email);
    };
  ```

* To submit user data to the server we are declaring `send()` function in variable `var send = function(){...};` and calling that function when submit `<button>` is triggered - **[CODE EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/js/emailnews.js)** from lines **60 - 76**

* Validation tests are covered in **[TESTING.MD](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/TESTING.md)** file

**GOOGLE API IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:**
  * Pick Google Maps product **[More info](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#quickstart)**
  * Create a project.
  * Set up a billing account.
  * Enable APIs associated with the products you picked.
  * Create an API key-  documentation source - **[API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)**
  * API keys for frontend-only applications cannot be hidden like is stated on the following link **[Hide API Keys](https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25)**, developers **[Comment](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/wireframes/API_Secure.png)**

**SCRIPTS INTEGRATION:**
  * In `<head>` element place `<scripts>` in following order:

    ```
  * Create `<div>` element with ID `<div id="map">` render map place
  * Marker Cluster CDN - **[SOURCE](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/js-marker-clusterer)**
  * Creating call-back function in `<script src="assets/js/maps.js"></script>` -  **[CODE EXAMPLE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/js/maps.js)** from lines **1 - 36** 

* `function initMap() {..}` maps location on a major scale in this case Dublin, Ireland
* `google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, "resize", function() {...}` adding Google Maps DOM listener
* `let busMarkerIcon = {...}` creating custom map marker with `scaledSize` property
* `const Bus747Stop = new google.maps.Marker({...});` pointing to Bus Stop for 747 Dublin Bus line for Dublin Airport

# TESTING

### Strategy and planning
* Testing is required on all features and user stories documented in this README file.
* All clickable links must redirect to the correct pages and sections.
* HTML Code must pass through the **[W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri)**.
* CSS Code must pass through the **[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**.
* JavaScript code must pass through the **[JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/)**.
* Python Code must pass through **[PEP8 Validator](http://pep8online.com/)**.
* Testing through **[Django Unit Testing Framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/)**.


### Test Cases and Description

![Test Cases](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/static/wireframes/Test_Cases.JPG)

### Access Requirements
The tester must be a Superuser to have access to the Django admin console to test the full functionality of the application.

### Regression Testing
All features previously tested during development in a local environment must be regression tested in production on the live website.

### Assumptions and Dependencies
Testing is dependent on the website being deployed live on Heroku.

### Out of Scope
Only test cases listed under High-Level Test Cases will be performed as part of this testing effort.

### Test Results
All processed tests and results are described in detail **[HERE](https://github.com/tsokac2/newirishlife/blob/main/TESTING.md)**
